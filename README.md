<summary><b>Childhood Computing</b> (????-1999)</summary>

#### BASIC Beginnings
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/lannocc/lannocc/raw/main/equipment/2021-01-06(5).jpg" width="250">
TRS-80, Commodore 64, Atari 520 ST... these are the machines of my childhood. Even for the time, they were by no means modern. I remember drooling over 386 and 486 computers when I spied them in a store-front window, but I knew we couldn't afford them. Even though plenty of games existed, that's not what was included in the hand-me-down tech that I was still gracious to receive. What was included were manuals, lots of manuals. So if this 10-year-old boy was going find anything interesting to do with these computers, he was going to have to write it himself! That's when I learned BASIC and thus began what was to be a life-long interest in programming.

#### Jump into Java
Sometime during my freshman and sophomore years of high school, I took two programming courses at the local junior college. Although these were just intoroductory classes, they finally exposed me to some "real" programming languages: C and C++. I excelled during class but they left me wanting more. When I was 15 or 16, that time when most teenagers are busy earning their driver's license and procuring a car, I bought a computer instead. That is, I ordered it piecemeal from about 10 different companies straight out of Computer Shopper magazine. And it worked! Finally, I had a "modern" machine: Cyrix P200+ CPU and 32MB RAM.

Fresh from the programming classes and with a decent computer, it was time to dig in. Just one problem: I couldn't afford the sorts of tools we used in class (Boreland C compiler). Anyways, there was this new language similar to C++ I was hearing about -- Java. It was getting a lot of buzz and I wanted to make my own web page applet. So I got the book: "Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours." That single source (tools included!) was all I needed to jump into Java 1.0 programming... and set me on a course of work for the next decade and beyond!
